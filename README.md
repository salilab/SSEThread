SSEThread : Integrative threading of protein structure using secondary structure elements

In brief, SSEThread proposes and scores threading solutions to protein structures with
ambiguous sequence assignment. It is designed specifically for use on elements of secondary structure
(helix, sheet), however any structure that is presumed static is usable.

The method relies upon and is built as a module (IMP.threading) in the Integrative Modeling Platform, of which a custom branch is contained here. 
It will be eventually incorporated into the main IMP codebase.
